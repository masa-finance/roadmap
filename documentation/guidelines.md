## Sprint guidelines

- Do not pickup cards which aren't groomed or part of the sprint backlog. Pick up only cards from this column (`Ready`)
- When picking up cards,  assign yourself the card and moving it to in progress
- If you are not sure what to pick, ask @Luka-Loncar @H34D or @mudler 
- Did you just completed a card? Awesome!! ðŸ’ª Before picking new challanges, check if there are stale items to review PRs or pair on cards if needed to help other team mates!
- If you are creating new cards as part of the spike, or something arise during the sprint, please move or add it in to the "Don't touch" column, add a `triage` label and please make sure it's in the radar of @Luka-Loncar  @H34D and/or @mudler
-  There are no pre-assigned tickets. You can pick any ticket from the Ready column above the waterline - when all tickets above the waterline are Done we can pick up those below the waterline
-  If there are bugs with prio: high, these should take precedence when picking up new tasks. If there are blockers for the team, pairing session (max 2) is encouraged.


## Review/PR guidelines

- During review make sure that a PR has a label for the type: e.g. `documentation`, `ci`, `enhancement` or `bug`
- Make sure that the PR follows conventional commits guidelines (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
