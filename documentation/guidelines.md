If you are not sure, here are few guidelines to follow!

- [ ] Do not pickup cards which aren't groomed or part of the sprint backlog. Pick up only cards from this column (`Ready`)
- [ ] When picking up cards,  assign yourself the card and moving it to in progress
- [ ] If you are not sure what to pick, ask @Luka-Loncar @H34D or @mudler 
- [ ] Did you just completed a card? Awesome!! ðŸ’ª Before picking new challanges, check if there are stale items to review PRs or pair on cards if needed to help other team mates!
- [ ] If you are creating new cards as part of the spike, or something arise during the sprint, please move or add it in to the "Don't touch" column, add a `triage` label and please make sure it's in the radar of @Luka-Loncar  @H34D and/or @mudler 

On PRs:

- During review make sure that a PR has a label for the type: e.g. `documentation`, `ci`, `enhancement` or `bug`
- Make sure that the PR follows conventional commits guidelines (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
