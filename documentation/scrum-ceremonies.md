## Retros

Retrospectives should be conducted monthly or bi-weekly using tools like Jamboards. These sessions aim to categorize events of the previous sprint into three groups: positive (good), negative (bad), and neutral (meh) experiences.

## Plannings ceremonies

During planning sessions, for each team, the Scrum Master should:

- Review the "Done" column with the team to confirm the completion of tasks.
- Assess tasks with the team in the "Under Review/QA" column to determine necessary actions for completion, going one by one to the tickets.
- Examine the "In Progress" tasks, checking the status of each with the team.
- Groom the "No Status/Backlog" items, moving relevant tasks into the sprint backlog.
  - Every card in the sprint:
    - Should have enough information for anyone in the team to pick that up
    - Every card should have a clear Problem statement,  an Acceptance criteria list if it's a spike, Action items if it's an implementation card
    - Ask for every card if it's clear for everyone
- Optionally, the team and the Scrum Master may estimate task sizes.
- Optionally, calculate the team's velocity.
- Review planned releases and prioritize tasks for the sprint backlog ( https://github.com/orgs/masa-finance/projects/12 ).
- Identify and prioritize any critical tasks needing immediate attention (issues with a swimlane priority tag).
- Commit to selected items in the sprint backlog, establishing a clear boundary of commitment (waterline).
- Assign a release captain if a release is scheduled during the sprint.
- Optionally, rotate the responsibility of handling interruptions in the team.

## Demos

Teams should schedule bi-weekly or monthly demos to showcase their work to peers. If applicable, a dedicated page should be set up for team members to request presentation slots.

## Dailies

Daily standups should focus on current sprint goals and potential blockers. 
Each engineer has the opportunity to discuss their daily agenda and any challenges they face. 
A recommended approach is to start with one person chosen randomly who then nominates the next speaker.

## Team healthchecks

Team healthchecks were introduced in Spotify. It's a way to assess the whole team healthcheck at least, in a bi-quarter basis. An example of such a document is: https://miro.com/miroverse/squad-health-check/.

The document needs to be completed async by the team members, and sent to the scrum master to collect and get the output - the output then is presented to the team to discuss action items to fix/address.

## Watercooler meeting

Informal watercooler meetings can be helpful to maintain team morale and foster a positive work environment.

## Spike

Spike tasks should comprehensively document all research findings. Necessary follow-ups should be identified and linked to the spike tasks. Ideally, spike documentation should provide sufficient context for any engineer to take over the task without needing prior knowledge of the topic.

## Epic

Epics should be bigger issues that does not fit into a single ticket. It is best to have epic tickets to track big features, breaking changes, or changes that imply changes in different codebases.
